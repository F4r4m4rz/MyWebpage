               <p>I started programming in my early ages. First language I started playing with was BASIC and fist play ground was a 386 computer.
                   <p>I graduated as B.Sc. of Civil engineering from Azad university of Qazvin, I learned Pascal at university where my first project was "Khayam-Pascal triangle".</p>
                   <p>I started my programming journey as a profession from 2016. the first language I started making programs with was PML - AVEVA programming macro language. I developed dozens of application with small and medium sizes for my employer.</p>
                   <p>PML was not enough for what I was trying to achieve therefore I started learning programming more proffesionally since 2017. Started with C and then C++. Early 2019 I attended a C# course and since then .Net and C# became my favoutire and field of expertize. </p>
                   <p>I have developed dozens of application in C#. I have been experiencing and trying various technologies and frameworks such as EntityFramework. After a while, I got into web development. I first tried ASP.NET to create web applications and RESTful apis. Although these projects were not enterprise projects and mostly personal and for fun, I could learn quite a lot about coding, desing patterns, algorithems and etc. . But may be the most valuable lesson for me was lacking of HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge.</p>
                   <p>To strengthen my skills in web development I started learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript while I still try to taste new technologies in .Net as Blazor.</p>
